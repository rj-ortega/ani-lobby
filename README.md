# Ani Lobby

Capstone project built in 3 weeks including technologies I had never worked with: [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Semantic React UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [Firebase O-Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) and [Golang](https://golang.org/) for the backend.
